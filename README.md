###An open-source POS system that's fully scalable to any use. 

---

## Overview

OpenPOS is a fresh idea for a POS system. It allows full modification of all parts of the system, allowing almost endless flexibility. With this, the system can be adapted for almost any use case, from a standalone retail unit for small businesses to a large cross-site system, with remote update deployability and localised networks within stores, to allow for the connection of multiple terminals.

OpenPOS is built natively to adapt to any screen size above 13", and is built for touch screen support.

## User Control

Managers and employees can have different permissions set easliy, with overriding these requiring permission by a manager. The system can be set on 'hard' mode, where a till is assigned to an employee and Managers are the only ones who can log out cashiers and change till floats, to 'soft' mode, where employee's can simply swipe their own card to log in, and floats are only changed at points throughout the day, rather than whenever an employee changes.

## Adding products

Adding products to the till is a native supported feature. To do so, managers on standalone units can simply go to Manager Menu > Product Control > Add Products and begin scanning products to add new ones or change stock levels, or on a local network or via an update package, this can be done from the Master till or the Internal Network Server.

## Product outages / activations
 
Sometimes, businesses can run out of any product. Whilst not ideal, these things happen, and OpenPOS is built to easily allow this to be managed. From any till, managers can go to the Manager Menu > Product Control > Product Outage, then either scan or enter the Outage Code (different from the barcode) of any product(s), press apply, and the sale of this item is automatically disabled, unless overridden.

To bring a product back, managers can enter the Product Control menu again, pressing Activate Product, and repeat the process in reverse.

## Documentation

Once the first alpha releases of the software are available, more detailed documentation will be provided.
